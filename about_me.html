        <p> Well hello there! My name is Jane Fernandez here's my story.
            If you met me when I was a child, and asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, 
            I automatically knew my answer. I wanted to be a <em>teacher.</em> That's right,
            I wanted to be a teacher! I wanted to be with kids, and teach them and advocate for them. 
            My answer never changed, when I got to high school, I still wanted to be a teacher, but didn't know 
            what kind of teacher. So I did what anyone else would do when they knew what they wanted in life, I made it happen. 
            I applied to different colleges, and thought, "Hmm, chemistry would be fun to teach!" 
            (Yeah I know, what was I thinking, I <em>can't</em> teach <em>chemistry</em>). I took my GE's and eventually found out
            that I could never be a chemistry teacher. So I tried for Liberal Studies, because I loved little kids! You know 
            I ended up finding out? I hated liberal studies. Maybe it was just my professors, but I hated every class I took, except one.
            I decided to change majors <em>again.</em> You would think by now I would realize that something was wrong
            with my major, but nope, I kept thinking I would love it. Anyways, that one class I loved, was Child Development. I loved 
            learning about how children grew up from when they were born, all the way up until their adolescence. I learned that there was a 
            way to become an educator with major, so I switched and finally graduated with a Bachelor's in Child and Adolescence Development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I got my next big break and was super excited to start teaching! I went into a Master's Degree program where 
            I had the chance to teach in my very own classroom full time, while also taking classes for my master's Degree in Education. That in
            itself was a rollercoaster of emotions, so I won't get into details about it. After getting my Master's Degree in Urban Education, 
            I went on to teach full time. After a couple of years, I realized teaching was not for me, and I wanted to find something else that 
            would fufill me, which was when I stumbled upon Computer Science, Software Developing, and Web Design. I really love everything about
            computers and technology, so this was the next best step for me. As of Fall 2024, I am taking a step to get my second Bachelor's in
            Applied Computer Science, where I am learning multiple different coding languages, and completely loving it! I cannot wait to gain more 
            coding languages, networking friends, and work on my inner creativity.
